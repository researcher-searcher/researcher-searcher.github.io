### About

A fast and flexible way to search for researchers using knowledge graphs, language models and natural language processing.

The initial platform was developed at the [University of Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/) via a [Jean Golding Institute](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/) seed corn grant.

The platform consists of the following components:

- [Setup](https://github.com/researcher-searcher/researcher-searcher-setup) - example using Pure data
- [Knowledge graph](https://github.com/researcher-searcher/researcher-searcher-graph) - built using Neo4j
- [NLP and search](https://github.com/researcher-searcher/researcher-searcher-search) - Spacy and Elasticsearch
- [API](https://github.com/researcher-searcher/researcher-searcher-api) - FastAPI
- [Web App](https://github.com/researcher-searcher/researcher-searcher-app) - demo using Dash
