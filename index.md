### About

A fast and flexible way to search for researchers using knowledge graphs, language models and natural language processing.

The initial platform was developed at the [University of Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/) via a [Jean Golding Institute](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/) seed corn grant.

The platform consists of the following components:

- [Setup - example using Pure data](https://github.com/researcher-searcher/researcher-searcher-setup)
- [Knowledge graph - built using Neo4j](https://github.com/researcher-searcher/researcher-searcher-graph)
- [NLP and search - Spacy and Elasticsearch](https://github.com/researcher-searcher/researcher-searcher-search)
